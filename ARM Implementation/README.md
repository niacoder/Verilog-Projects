Implement the single-cycle ARM architecture in Verilog to support the following instructions (ISA): LDUR, STUR, ADD, SUB, AND, ORR, CBZ, and B.
Use datapath of Overall ARM Architecture, ALU Control Truth Table, and Main Control Truth Table (figures in textbook)

Testbench connects main cpu and both memory files - register file array is initialized with data from reg_file.txt, and instruction file is initialized with data from ins_file.txt
